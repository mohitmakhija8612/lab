                <li>
                 Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat the skillet over medium heat
                </li>
                <li>
                    Butter one side of each slice of bread
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)
                </li>
                <li>
                
                Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese
            </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>
                NOTE :
            </strong>
            <li>
                Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.

                4 Large potatoes
            </li>
            <li>
                a pot of boiling water

                a pot of oil heated to 350 degrees fahrenheit
